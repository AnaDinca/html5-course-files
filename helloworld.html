        <h1>Hello Web Browser</h1>
        <p>
            Hello Web Browser, my name is Yatit and I want to give you some information about HTML.
        </p>
        <h2>Subtitle</h2>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isn't HTML easy? I'm sure you know a lot about HTML, Web Browser. Especially because you are the one displaying it to me.
            <br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey Web Browser, let me tell you a bit more about HTML. We can also do special characters inside HTML.
            <br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, to do a less-than sign, we need to enclose it inside an &amp; followed by its special HTML character map &lt; finally ended by a ; 
        </p>
        <p>
            &mu;, &lambda;, &delta;, &Delta;, and other Greek characters make for great special characters.
        </p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p>Yatit</p>
