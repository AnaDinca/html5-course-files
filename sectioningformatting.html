            </summary>
            It turns out, an Apple has natural teeth-cleaning properties that keep your teeth whiter. The fibrous parts of the apple act as a natural floss when you bite down on it, and it doesn’t cause any bleeding! You should naturally still brush twice a day (and floss), but Apples will give you that teeth-cleaning boost.
