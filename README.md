# html5-course-files
A collection of files used in the HTML5 course. Each file generally covers the material included in one video. They are also designed to be self-contained versions of concepts and tags in HTML5.

Note that some files may not show multimedia elements properly because Github does not support uploading large multimedia files. For this, I recommend fixing the issue locally by adding a similarly named file of the same type in the same folder as the HTML file.
